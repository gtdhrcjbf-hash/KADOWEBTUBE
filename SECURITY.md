## 🎯 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🔒 Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Session timeout and automatic logout
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Data Protection
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for data in transit
- Database connection encryption
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries

### API Security
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Request validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- API key rotation capabilities
- Request/response logging for audit trails

### Infrastructure Security
- Docker container security best practices
- Environment variable protection
- Database access restrictions
- Redis security configuration
- Regular dependency updates

### Code Security
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security reviews
- Automated security testing

## 🚨 Security Best Practices for Users

### For Administrators
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- Monitor system logs for suspicious activity
- Keep the system updated to the latest version
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Regular database backups with encryption

### For Developers
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Regular dependency updates
- Code review before merging

## 🔍 Security Testing

We regularly perform:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning**
- **Penetration testing** (quarterly)
- **Code reviews** with security focus
- **Infrastructure security assessments**

## 📚 Security Resources

### Secure Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Strong JWT secrets (minimum 32 characters)
JWT_SECRET=your_very_strong_jwt_secret_key_here_minimum_32_chars
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_very_strong_refresh_secret_key_here_minimum_32_chars

# Encryption key (exactly 32 characters)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key_12

# Secure database connection
DB_SSL=true
DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=true

# Rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000  # 15 minutes
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100   # 100 requests per window

# CORS settings
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://app.yourdomain.com
```

#### Nginx Security Headers
```nginx
server {
    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
    add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'" always;
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
    
    # Hide server information
    server_tokens off;
}
```

### Database Security

#### PostgreSQL Configuration
```sql
-- Create dedicated user with limited privileges
CREATE USER kadowebtube_app WITH PASSWORD 'strong_password_here';

-- Grant only necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO kadowebtube_app;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO kadowebtube_app;

-- Enable SSL
ssl = on
ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
ssl_key_file = 'server.key'
```

## 🚩 Known Security Considerations
