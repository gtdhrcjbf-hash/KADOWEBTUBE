## üìè Code Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Follow the existing code style (we use ESLint and Prettier)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused

### Example Code Style
```javascript
/**
 * Creates a new campaign with the provided data
 * @param {Object} campaignData - The campaign data
 * @param {string} campaignData.name - Campaign name
 * @param {string} campaignData.targetUrl - Target YouTube URL
 * @param {number} campaignData.quantity - Number of engagements
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Created campaign object
 */
async function createCampaign(campaignData) {
    const { name, targetUrl, quantity } = campaignData;
    
    // Validate input data
    if (!name || !targetUrl || !quantity) {
        throw new ValidationError('Missing required campaign data');
    }
    
    // Create campaign logic here
    const campaign = await Campaign.create(campaignData);
    
    return campaign;
}
```

### Database Standards
- Use descriptive table and column names
- Add proper indexes for performance
- Include foreign key constraints
- Add comments for complex queries

### API Standards
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use consistent response formats
- Include proper HTTP status codes
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Document all endpoints

## üß™ Testing

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/campaign.test.js
```

### Test Structure
```javascript
describe('Campaign Service', () => {
    describe('createCampaign', () => {
        it('should create a campaign with valid data', async () => {
            // Arrange
            const campaignData = {
                name: 'Test Campaign',
                targetUrl: 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=test',
                quantity: 1000
            };
            
            // Act
            const result = await createCampaign(campaignData);
            
            // Assert
            expect(result).toBeDefined();
            expect(result.name).toBe(campaignData.name);
        });
    });
});
```
